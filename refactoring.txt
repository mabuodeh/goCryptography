Will need to refactor because code base is messed up and confusing.
Currently working on block and stream ciphers. Taking relevant functions from set1,
and refactoring in general to make sure functions are in the right place before proceeding.


DONE - set1:
From 1-6 just basics. Leave them in set1, and take the AES ECB stuff to a different package.
taken. will remove old ones later
old ones removed

set2:
Deals with block ciphers, specifically AES:
- padding
- ECB
- CBC

set3 and 4 also deal with block ciphers (and the randomness of the block ciphers)

set5 onward are other concepts (I think)
